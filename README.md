# Friend Recommendation System [WIP]

### Overview 
Facebook is a social media platform that connects people who may know each other. By leveraging advanced algorithms and user data analysis, the system identifies common interests, mutual connections, and relevant activities to propose individuals who are likely to share meaningful connections.

1. Users should have the ability to send, cancel, accept, reject and delete friend requests 
2. The system should be able to suggest potential friends based on mutual connections. 
3. Users should be able to provide basic information.
4. Users should only receive newly updated lists when new users are added or updates are made, rather than with every reload.
